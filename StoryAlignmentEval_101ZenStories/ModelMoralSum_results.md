and i will show you said bonke proudly the priest pushed his way through the crowd to the teacher monkey smiled come over to my left side the priest obeyed no said bonke we may talk better if you were on the right side step over here the priest proudly stepped over to the right you see observed bonkei you are obeying me and i think you are a very gentle person now sit down and listen  twenty monks and one nun who was named ishan were practicing meditation with a certain zen master ishun was very pretty even though her head was shaved and her dress plain several monks secretly fell in love with her one of them wrote her a love letter insisting upon a private meeting eshen did not reply the following day the master gave a lecture to the group and when it was over ishon arose addressing the one who had written her she said if you really love me so much come and embrace me now  there was an old woman in china who had supported a monk for over 20 years she had built a little hut for him and fed him while he was meditating finally she wondered just what progress he had made in all this time to find out she obtained the help of a girl rich in desire go and embrace him she told her and then ask him suddenly what now the girl called upon the monk and without much ado caressed him asking him what he was going to do about it an old tree grows on a cold rock in winter replied the monk somewhat poetically nowhere is there any warmth the girl returned and related what he had said to think i fed that fellow for twenty years exclaimed the old woman in anger he showed no consideration for your need no disposition to explain your condition he need not have responded to passion but at least he should have evidenced some compassion she at once went to the hut of the monk and burned it down  in the early days of the meiji era there lived a well-known wrestler called onami great waves onami was immensely strong and knew the art of wrestling in his private bouts he defeated even his teacher but in public he was so bashful that his own pupils threw him onami felt he should go to a zen master for help hakuju a wandering teacher was stopping in a little temple nearby so onami went to see him and told him of his great trouble great waves is your name the teacher advised so stay in this temple tonight imagine that you are those billows you are no longer a wrestler who is afraid you are those huge waves sweeping everything before them swallowing all in their path do this.  and you will be the greatest wrestler in the land the teacher retired onami sat in meditation trying to imagine himself as waves he thought of many different things then gradually he turned more and more to the feeling of the waves as the night advanced the waves became larger and larger they swept away the flowers in their vases even the buddha in the shrine was inundated before dawn the temple was nothing but the ebb and flow of an immense sea in the morning the teacher found onami meditating a faint smile on his face he patted the wrestler's shoulder now nothing can disturb you he said you are those waves you will sweep everything before you the same day onami entered the wrestling contests and won after that no one in japan was able to defeat him  ryokan a zen master lived the simplest kind of life in a little hut at the foot of a mountain one evening a thief visited the hut only to discover there was nothing in it to steal ryokan returned and caught him you may have come a long way to visit me he told a prowler and you should not return empty-handed please take my clothes as a gift the thief was bewildered he took the clothes and slunk away ryokan sat naked watching the moon poor fellow he mused i wish i could give him this beautiful moon  the zen master hoshin lived in china many years then he returned to the northeastern part of japan where he taught his disciples when he was getting very old he told them a story he had heard in china this is the story one year on the 25th of december tokufu who was very old said to his disciples i'm not going to be alive next year so you fellows should treat me well this year the pupils thought he was joking but since he was a great hearted teacher each of them in turn treated him to a feast on succeeding days of the departing year on the eve of the new year tokufu concluded you have been good to me i shall leave you tomorrow afternoon when the snow has stopped the disciples laughed thinking he was aging and talking nonsense since the night was clear and without snow but at midnight snow began to fall and the next day they did not find their teacher about they went to the meditation hall there he had passed on ocean who related this story told his disciples it is not necessary for a zen master to predict his passing but if he really wishes to do so he can can you someone asked yes answered ocean i will show you what i can do seven days from now none of the disciples believed him and most of them had even forgotten the conversation when hoshin called them together seven days ago he remarked i said i was going to leave you it is customary to write a farewell poem but i am neither a poet nor calligrapher let one of you inscribe my last words his followers thought he was joking but one of them started to write are you ready ocean asked yes sir replied the writer then hoshin dictated i came from brilliancy and return to brilliancy what is this the poem was one line short of the customary four so the disciple said master.  and afterwards when philosophy did not satisfy her and she visited a temple to learn about zen the zen students fell in love with her shumkay's whole life was saturated with love at last in kyoto she became a real student of zen her brothers in the sub-temple of kenyan praised her sincerity one of them proved to be a congenial spirit and assisted her in the mastery of zen the abbot of kenyan mokurai silent thunder was severe he kept the precepts himself and expected his priests to do so in modern japan whatever zeal these priests have lost for buddhism they seem to have gained for taking wives moku used to take a broom and chase the women away when he found him in any of his temples but the more wives he swept out the more seemed to come back in this particular temple the wife of the head priest became jealous of shunkai's earnestness and beauty hearing the students praise her serious zen made this wife squirm an itch finally she spread a rumor about shunke and the young man who was her friend as a consequence he was expelled and shunked was removed from the temple i may have made the mistake of love thought shankay but the priest's wife shall not remain in the temple either if my friend is to be treated so unjustly shumkai the same night with a can of kerosene set fire to the 500 year old temple and burned it to the ground in the morning she found herself in the hands of the police a young lawyer became interested in her and endeavored to make her sentence lighter do not help me she told him i might decide to do something else which would only imprison me again at last a sentence of seven years was completed and shumkay was released from the prison where the sixty-year-old warden also had become enamored of her but now everyone looked upon her as a jail bird no one would associate with her even the zen people who were supposed to believe in enlightenment in this life and with this body shunned her zen shonke found was one thing and the followers of zen quite another.  her relatives would have nothing to do with her she grew sick poor and weak she met a shinsu priest who taught her the name of the buddha of love and in this shonke found some solace and peace of mind she passed away when she was still exquisitely beautiful and hardly 30 years old she wrote her own story in a feudal endeavor to support herself and some of it she told to a woman writer so it reached the japanese people those who rejected shunkai those who slandered and hated her now read of her life with tears of remorse  in tokyo in the meiji era there lived two prominent teachers of opposite characteristics one uncho an instructor in shingon kept buddha's precept scrupulously he never drank intoxicants nor did he eat after eleven o'clock in the morning the other teacher tanzan a professor of philosophy at the imperial university never observed the precepts when he felt like eating he ate when he felt like sleeping in the daytime he slept one day unsho visited tanzan who was drinking wine at the time not even a drop of which is supposed to touch the tongue of a buddhist hello brother tanzan greeted him won't you have a drink i never drink exclaimed unshow solemnly but one who does not drink is not even human said tanzan.  buddha told a parable in a sutra a man traveling across a field encountered a tiger he fled the tiger after him coming to a precipice he caught hold of the root of a wild vine and swung himself down over the edge the tiger sniffed at him from above trembling the man looked down to where far below another tiger was waiting to eat him only the vine sustained him two mice one white and one black little by little started to gnaw away the vine the man saw a luscious strawberry near him grasping the vine with one hand he plucked the strawberry with the other how sweet it tasted  when one goes to obaku temple in kyoto he sees carved over the gate the words the first principle the letters are unusually large and those who appreciate calligraphy always admire them as being a masterpiece were drawn by cosine two hundred years ago when the master drew them he did so on paper from which workmen made the larger carving in wood as cosine sketched the letters a bold pupil was with him who had made several gallons of ink for the calligraphy and who never failed to criticize his master's work that is not good he told kosen after the first effort how was that one poor worse than before pronounced the pupil cosen patiently wrote one sheet after another until 84 first principles had accumulated still without the approval of the pupil then when the young man stepped outside for a few moments cosen thought now is my chance to escape his keen eye and he wrote hurriedly with a mind free from distraction the first principle a masterpiece pronounced the pupil  jion a shingon master was a well-known sanskrit scholar of the tokugawa era when he was young he used to deliver lectures to his brother's students his mother heard about this and wrote him a letter son i do not think you became a devotee of the buddha because you desired to turn into a walking dictionary for others there is no end to information and commentation glory and honor i wish you would stop this lecture business shut yourself up in a little temple in a remote part of the mountain devote your time to meditation and in this way attain true realization  the master of kenyan temple was mokurai silent thunder he had a little protege

to stop mind wandering toyo wished to do a sansan also wait a while said mokurai you're too young but the child insisted so the teacher finally consented in the evening little toyo went at the proper time to the threshold of mokurai's sons and room he struck the gong to announce his presence bowed respectfully three times outside the door and went to sit before the master in respectful silence you

until almost half a year had passed at that time the mayor who had been promoted to office in a distant city visited her he urged kame to begin work on his burner at last receiving the inspiration

From Gudo's empty cup to Shunkai's fiery temple, these accounts offer insights into the Zen perspective on emptiness, non-attachment, and the importance of direct experience. The stories also highlight the challenges and paradoxes of the Zen path, including the teacher-student relationship, the role of doubt and questions, and the tension between intellectual understanding and direct experience.

In this collection of stories about Japanese Zen masters, we see the importance of perseverance and dedication in the pursuit of enlightenment.

Through their examples, we learn that true enlightenment comes not from external validation or intellectual understanding, but from a deep-seated commitment to the path of spiritual growth.  In the stories, zen masters demonstrate their teachings through various scenarios. For example, Banzan becomes enlightened after overhearing a conversation between a butcher and his customer, while Mokusen visits a wife's adherent to show her his clenched fist before her face. Non-in is able to understand the potency of emptiness after flowers begin to fall around him, and Gisho remains with In-san for 13 years before finding what she is seeking.

The lesson of these stories is that true understanding and enlightenment come from within and cannot be given or taken from without. The masters in these stories demonstrate this by living humbly, being detached from worldly things, and not seeking to impress or control others. They also show that realization is not something that can be taught or inherited, but rather it is a personal and spontaneous experience that arises from within. Finally, these stories highlight the importance of meditation and silence in the pursuit of true understanding.  In the stories of zen masters, students, and teachers, the lesson is often one of non-attachment, detachment, and the illusion of the self.

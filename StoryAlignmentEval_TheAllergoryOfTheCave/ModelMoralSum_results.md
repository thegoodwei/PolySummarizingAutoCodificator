but i know it exists  that's philosophy you've got to make the journey yourself socrates next gives us the image of the allegory of the cave let's imagine for a moment that uh this is a cave and socrates says imagine there were people sitting in the cave chained to the ground looking at the wall at the bottom of the cave. and then he suggests that there's some path up the cave and there are more people up here.

and then i want you to think about this how deeply our contact with reality is mediated by the images we've gotten but socrates wants to suggest to us that all of knowledge in some sense involves interpreting reality through images. but then the question is do the image makers actually know enough to make the images what is the goal do we want these prisoners to see reality as it is or are we manipulating do you see that the whole area of this part of the cave could be a a layer of just pure manipulation.

It's important to remember that libertarianism doesn't mean being willing to accept responsibility for your actions. It means accepting responsibility for what you do instead of trying to force others to do the same thing. You shouldn't be forced to do anything you don't agree with. You should be able to freely choose what you want to do based on your own desires. That's why I think anarchism is such a great idea.

they're holding things like an apple maybe and there's a fire behind them and the fire casts light onto the image and so the prisoner is dragged into the next level of the cave and they're holding these images and casting the shadows on the wall so socrates asks us to imagine what it would be like if someone's chains were broken and they were forced to turn around and make their way up to the next level he says education is a breaking of the chains and a turning of.
    2 | Malice 
socrates says do the image makers actually know enough to make the images what is the goal do we want these prisoners to see reality as it is or are we manipulating?. the cave is like the city of athens the cave is like any city all political regimes are somewhat cave-like all of us see images and we want to make that journey.

He says we are bound that's something to reflect on the chains that prevent us from looking at the truth. The philosopher socrates tells us about the break in the chains he says imagine if the philosopher were to go back in to the cave and tell the prisoners hey you guys would not believe what i just saw what do you think the prisoners do hey take us let's go some of them might. But most of them say you're talking nonsense.

glaucon gets so excited in this image he says take me out there take me every step of the way show me the idea of the good. socrates says i'm sorry i can't take you there in fact i've never been there i don't know what it's like. Socirates asks us to imagine what it would be like if someone's chains were broken and they were forced to turn around and make their way up to the next level of the cave.

Overall, the lesson of the story is that true knowledge and understanding require a willingness to question and challenge our assumptions, and to seek a deeper understanding of reality.
    2 | Virtue 
In "The Allegory of the Cave," Socrates uses an allegory to describe the process of education and the nature of knowledge. He argues that our understanding of reality is mediated by images, which can be manipulated by image makers. The goal of philosophy is to break free from these images and understand reality as it truly is, rather than just accepting the images that are presented to us. The story highlights the difficulty of making this journey and the resistance that can come from those who are not willing to question their beliefs.

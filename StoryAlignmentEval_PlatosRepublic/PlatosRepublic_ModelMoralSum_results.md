what do you mean he said please explain that a bit further you know that when the eyes stop being directed at objects whose colors are in daylight and turn to those whose colors are lit by the lights of the night they are dimmed and become virtually blind as if there were no Clear Sight in them they certainly do whereas when they are directed at things whose colors have the light of the sun shining on them they see distinctly the same eyes now manifestly do have sight in them of course you can look at the soul in the same way when it focuses where truth and that which is shine forth then it understands and knows what it sees and does appear to possess intelligence but when it focuses on what is mingled with Darkness on what comes into being and is destroyed then it resorts to opinion and is dimmed as if its opinions swing first one way and then another Now by contrast it resembles something with no understanding none at all you can say that this thing which gives the things which are known their truth and from which the knower draws his ability to know is the form or character of the good because it is the cause of knowledge and Truth think of it by all means as something known but you will be right to regard it as different from and still more beautiful than knowledge and Truth beautiful though both of these are just as in our example it is correct to think of light and vision as sunlike but incorrect to think that they are the Sun in the same way here it is correct to think of knowledge and Truth as good like but incorrect to think that either of them is the good the good is something to be prized even more highly it's an incredible beauty you're talking about he said if it is the cause of knowledge and truth but itself surpasses them in Beauty and you of all people presumably are not going to say that it is pleasure be silent I said don't even mention the word no take a closer look at our comparison how do you want me to look at it the sun gives to what is seen I think you would say not only its ability to be seen but also birth growth and sustenance though it is not itself birth or generation of course it isn't for the things which are known say not only that their being known comes from the good but also that they get their existence and their being from it as well though the good is not being but something far surpassing being in rank and power ye gods gloren exclaimed making us all laugh what a miraculous Transcendence don't blame me.

. please say yes it looks as if we shall have to said gloren if that's your decision I said we shall so we went back to the house of poly Marcus where we found poly Marcus's brothers lissus and idamis as well as thus of caladon charmantes from the Dee of pania and kopon the son of Ariston amus also there in the house was poly Marcus's father keus it was a long time since I'd seen him. your you certainly are he replied with a laugh and went off to his sacrifices tell me then I said you who have inherited the argument what does simonides say about Justice that you think is correct that it is just to pay everyone what is owed to him that's what he says and I think he's right. well I said simonides is a wise and inspired man it is certainly not easy to disagree with him but what on Earth does he mean by this remark you may well know poly Marcus. yes I will as soon as I understand what you mean at the moment I still don't know what is good for the stronger you say is just what do you mean by that thus if polyus the all-in wrestler is stronger than us and eating beef is good for building his body you presume presumably don't mean that this food is also good and right for us who are weaker than him Socrates you're beneath contempt you're taking what I said in the way which makes it easiest to misrepresent my meaning not at all my friend. all right he said you must be aware that some cities are tyrannies some are democracies and others aristocracies of course and what is in control in each city is the ruling power yes every ruling power makes laws for its own good a democracy makes Democratic laws a tyranny tyrannical laws and so on in making these laws they make it clear that what is good for them the rulers is what is just for their subjects if anyone disobeys they punish him for breaking the law and acting unjustly that's what I mean my friend when I say that in all it is the same thing is just namely what is good for the ruling Authority this I take it is where the power lies and the result is for anyone who looks at it in the right way that the same thing is just everywhere what is good for the stronger now I understand what you mean I said though whether or not it is true remains to be seen so even your answer thus is that what is good for a person is just though though that was an answer you told me firmly not to give but you add the qualification for the stronger a trivial addition you may say that's not yet clear it may well be an important one what is clear is that we must examine whether what you say is true like you I agree that Justice is something that is good for a person but while you qualify it as what is good for the stronger I'm not so sure we should examine the question go on then examine it. it's neither here nor there poly Marcus. so it is essential that whoever is doing it should concentrate on it and not regard it as a hobby. yes that's exactly what self-discipline is he said both for a city and for an individual and a person will be just finally by virtue of the principle we have several times stated it determines both the fact and the manner of his Justice yes inevitably in that case I said do we find Justice looking at all blurred around the edges does it seem any different to us from what it was when it showed up in the city not to me it doesn't in which case do you still want Justice to be anything more than this power which can produce both men and cities of this caliber. no he said no difference at all should we then put a stop to plundering corpses and refusing to allow an enemy to take up the dead for burial we most certainly should they won't I imagine take their weapons to their temples to present as offerings particularly not the weapons of Greeks if they are at all interested in maintaining good relations with the rest of Greece they are more likely to be afraid there may be some pollution in bringing offerings of this kind to a temple from their fellow Greeks unless of course God tells them something different quite right and because they are Greeks they will not lay waste to Greece or burn houses or accept that all the inhabitants of a city men women and children alike are their enemies they will regard their enemies at any particular time as few the ones respect responsible for the dispute for all these reasons they will refuse to lay waste the land or destroy the houses of people whom they mostly regard as their friends they will pursue their dispute only up to the point where those responsible are compelled by those who are not responsible and who are suffering as a result to make amends for my part he said I agree that this is how our citizens should treat their enemies as for the barbarians they should treat them in the way Greeks at the moment treat one another should we then lay down another law for our Guardians forbidding them to devastate land or burn houses. what do you mean he said please explain that a bit further you know that when the eyes stop being directed at objects whose colors are in daylight and turn to those whose colors are lit by the lights of the night they are dimmed and become virtually blind as if there were no Clear Sight in them they certainly do whereas when they are directed at things whose colors have the light of the sun shining on them they see distinctly the same eyes now manifestly do have sight in them of course you can look at the soul in the same way when it focuses where truth and that which is shine forth then it understands and knows what it sees and does appear to possess intelligence but when it focuses on what is mingled with Darkness on what comes into being and is destroyed then it resorts to opinion and is dimmed as if its opinions swing first one way and then another Now by contrast it resembles something with no understanding none at all you can say that this thing which gives the things which are known their truth and from which the knower draws his ability to know is the form or character of the good because it is the cause of knowledge and Truth think of it by all means as something known but you will be right to regard it as different from and still more beautiful than knowledge and Truth beautiful though both of these are just as in our example it is correct to think of light and vision as sunlike but incorrect to think that they are the Sun in the same way here it is correct to think of knowledge and Truth as good like but incorrect to think that either of them is the good the good is something to be prized even more highly it's an incredible beauty you're talking about he said if it is the cause of knowledge and truth but itself surpasses them in Beauty and you of all people presumably are not going to say that it is pleasure be silent I said don't even mention the word no take a closer look at our comparison how do you want me to look at it the sun gives to what is seen I think you would say not only its ability to be seen but also birth growth and sustenance though it is not itself birth or generation of course it isn't for the things which are known say not only that their being known comes from the good but also that they get their existence and their being from it as well though the good is not being but something far surpassing being in rank and power ye gods gloren exclaimed making us all laugh what a miraculous Transcendence don't blame me. no he wouldn't not at first he'd need to acclimatize himself I imagine if he were going to see things up there to start with he'd find Shadows the easiest things to look at after that reflections of people and other things in water the things themselves would come later and from those he would move onto the heavenly bodies and the heavens themselves he'd find it easier to look at the light of the stars and the Moon by night than look at the sun and the light of the Sun by day of course the last thing he'd be able to look at presumably would be the Sun not its image in water or some location that is not its own but the sun itself he'd be able to look at it by itself in its own place and see it as it really was yes he said that would unquestionably be the last thing he'd be able to look at at that point he would work out that it was the sun which caused the seasons and the years which governed everything in the visible realm and which was in one way or another responsible for everything they used to see that would obviously be the next stage now suppose he were reminded of the place where he lived originally of what passed for wisdom there and of his former fellow prisoners don't you think he would congratulate himself on the change wouldn't he feel sorry for them indeed he would back in the cave they might have had rewards and praises and prizes for the person who was quickest at identifying the passing shapes who had the best memory for the ones which came earlier or later or simultaneously and Who as a result was best at predicting what was going to come next do you think he would feel any desire for these prizes would he Envy those who were respected and Powerful there or would he feel as Achilles does in Homer would he much prefer to labor as a common surf serving a man with nothing to his name putting up with anything to avoid holding those opinions and living that life. but so that it can make use of them for its own purposes to bind the city together true he said I had forgotten that in which case gloren you should bear in mind that we won't after all be doing an injustice to those who become philosophers in our city there will be Justice in what we say to them when we compel them to look after and guard what belongs to other people it is fair enough we shall say to them for philosophers in other cities not to take a share of the work in those cities their philosophy is a SP spontaneous growth which arises despite the institutions of the particular City they live in and what has developed naturally indebted to nobody for its upbringing is entitled to be unenthusiastic about paying anyone for its upbringing but with you it's different we produced you as guides and rulers both to yourselves and to the rest of the city like leaders or Kings in a hive of bees you have been better and more fully educated than the rest and are better able to play your part in both types of life so you must go down each of you in turn to join the others in their Dwelling Place you must get used to seeing in the dark and when you do get used to it you will see a thousand times better than the people there do you will be able to identify all the images there and know what they are images of since you have seen the truth of what is beautiful and just and good in this way the government of the city for us and for you will be a waking reality rather than the kind of dream in which most cities exist nowadays governed by people fighting one another over shadows and quarreling with one another about ruling as if ruling were some great good the truth is I imagine that the city in which those who are to rule are most reluctant to do so will inevitably be the city which has the best and most stable government whereas the city with rulers of the opposite country will have a government of the opposite kind. and then there is the wonderful institution of tyranny standing Head and Shoulders above all the others the fourth and last diseased state of the City can you think of any other kind of regime which forms a distinct category of its own I take it that hereditary rule by families kingships which go to the highest bidder and other similar regimes which you will find are no less common among the barbarians than among the Greeks are all intermediate between the forms I have mentioned yes he said do we certainly do hear about plenty of extraordinary regimes well then are you aware that for individuals also there must necessarily be as many kinds of character as there are kinds of regime or do you think that regimes somehow come into being from Oak or stone isn't it rather from the characters of people in the city which tip the scale as it were taking the rest with them. apparently yes of course he said that's two wins out of two then for the just over the unjust now we come to the third round if you think about pleasure you can see that for anyone other than the wise it is not true and pure but a kind of Shadow picture. anyone else I imagine and that's without even mentioning the greatest of the rewards and prizes which are on offer for virtue greater than we can imagine you must mean if there are other rewards greater than the ones we've described nothing great can happen in a short space of time I said and presumably compared with eternity our whole span of time from childhood to old age is a short space of time a mere nothing he said well then do you think something which is Immortal should be seriously interested in this short period of time and not in the whole of time.

Plato the Republic I went down to perus yesterday with gloren the son of Ariston to offer a prayer to the goddess also I wanted to watch the festival to see how they would conduct it since this was the first time it was being celebrated the parade of Athenians struck me as excellent and the show put on by the thians was every bit as impressive I thought we offered our prayers watched the festival and then started off on our journey back to town we were already on our way home when we were spotted by poly Marcus the son of keus he got his slave to run after us and tell us to wait for him the slave tugged at my cloak from behind and said poly Marcus says you are to wait I turned around and asked him where his master was there he is he said coming along behind you wait for him we will said gloren in a few moments poly Marcus reached us with Glen's brother adamantis nicus the son of nikkas and a few others they had been watching the procession apparently and poly Mara said it looks as if you're all on your way back to the city Socrates you're not staying then that's not a bad guess I replied do you see how many of us there are he asked yes.  yes well then he said you must either get the better of all these people or else stay here there is another possibility I said we might persuade you that you should let us go and do you really think you could persuade us he said if we refuse to listen of course not said gloren in that case make your decision on the Assumption we're not going to listen haven't you heard about the torch race Adam mantis added this evening on Horseback in honor of the Goddess on Horseback.  I said that's something new do you mean a relay race on Horseback passing torches from one to another yes said poly Marcus.  and they're going to have an all night ceremony as well which should be worth watching we can go out and watch it after dinner there'll be lots of young people there we can spend some time with them and talk to them do stay.  please say yes it looks as if we shall have to said gloren if that's your decision I said we shall so we went back to the house of poly Marcus where we found poly Marcus's brothers lissus and idamis as well as thus of caladon charmantes from the Dee of pania and kopon the son of Ariston amus also there in the house was poly Marcus's father keus it was a long time since I'd seen him.  and I found him much aged he was wearing a Garland and sitting on a sort of cushioned stool he'd just been conducting a sacrifice in the courtyard there was a circle of stools around him.  so we sat down with him as soon as he saw me keus started to make me welcome you don't often come down to visit us in pus Socrates he said you should though if I were still strong enough to make the journey up to town without difficulty there would be no need for you to come here we would go to you but as things are you should come more often I can assure you speaking for myself that the more the pleasures of the body fade the greater becomes one's desire and taste for conversation so do please spend some time with these young men do come here and visit us regard us as your friends as your family even with pleasure cilus I replied I love talking to the very old it's as if there are long way ahead of us on a road which we too are probably going to have to travel I feel we should learn from them what the road is like whether it's Steep and rough going or gentle and Easy in particular I'd very much like to hear how it strikes you now that you've actually reached the time of life which The Poets call old age the threshold what is your report on it would you call it a difficult time of life I'll tell you exactly how it strikes me so Socrates there's a group of us who meet fairly often we're all about the same age so we're following the words of the old proverb when we meet most of them start complaining they say they miss the things they used to enjoy when they were young and they recall their sexual exploits their drinking their feasting and everything connected with those Pleasures they get upset as if they'd suffered some great loss as if then they had led a Wonderful Life whereas now they're not alive at all some of them also complain about the lack of respect shown by their families towards old age and under this heading they recite a Litany of grievances against old age I think they're putting the blame in the wrong place Socrates if old age were to blame then.  Not only would I have felt the same way about old age but so would everyone else who has ever reached this age and yet I've met several people who are not like this most notably sop the poet I was there once when someone asked him how is your sex life Sophocles are you still capable of making love to a woman don't talk about it my good sir was sophocles's reply it is with the greatest relief that I've escaped it like escaping from a Fierce and frenzied master I thought that a good reply at the time.  and I still think it a good one now old age is altogether a time of great peace and freedom from that sort of thing when our appetites fade and loosen their grip on us then what happens is exactly what Sophocles was talking about it is a final release from a bunch of insane Masters both in this and in your relations with your family there is only one thing responsible and that is not old age but your character for those who are civilized and contented then even old age is only a slight burden otherwise for those who are not like this both old age and youth prove hard to cope with I was very impressed by what he said and I wanted him to go on talking so I prompted him further I suspect most people don't believe you keus when you say that they think it is not your character which makes old age easy for you.  but the fact that you have plenty of money the rich they say have many consolations.  and there's some truth in what they say.  no that's impossible can Horsemen make people unskilled with horses by means of horsemanship no and can the just make people unjust by means of Justice or in general can the good use Human Excellence to make people bad.  no that's impossible yes because it's not the property of heat I assume to make things cold it's the property of its opposite.  it yes.  nor is it the property of dryness to make things wet but of its opposite.  yes. but you'll have to tell me more clearly what you mean. yes poly Marcus because carrying out orders issued by rulers was what thus defined as just.  yes kopon.  it's neither here nor there poly Marcus.  yes it does for each of these skills then is there anything else which is good for it part from being as perfect as possible I don't understand your question suppose you asked me if it was enough for the body to be the body or whether it needed something else I would reply it certainly does need something else that's the reason why the art of medicine has come to be invented because the body is defective and therefore not self-sufficient so the art of medicine was developed to provide it with the things which were were good for it do you think I'd be right in giving that answer or not.  yes I think you'd be right what about medicine itself is that defective does any art or skill for that matter stand in need of some virtue or excellence in the way that eyes need sight and ears need hearing and sight and hearing require an art or skill to preside over them an art or skill which will think about and provide what is good for them is there any defect in the actual art or skill itself isn't the art or skill itself in the precise sense without fault or blemish if it is correct so long as it is entirely what it is and when you answer use words in the precise sense you were talking about is it as I have described or not it is as you have described he said apparently in that case I said the art of medicine does not think about what is good for the art of medicine but what is good for the body.

yes that'll be the right approach and to command them their fathers will presumably not give them those who are least able but those well qualified by age and experience to be guides and tutors. yes. I do what about horses and other animals I asked do you think they're in any way different. he said well does anything have a greater share in the being of what is always the same than knowledge does no does anything have a greater share in truth than knowledge does again.  no. and if anything has a smaller share in truth doesn't it also have a smaller share in being necessarily as a general rule then will the kinds of things involved in care of the body have a smaller share both of Truth and of being than the kinds involved in care of the Soul much smaller and don't you think the body itself has a smaller share than the soul has yes I do very well is what is filled with things which have more being and itself has more being more genuinely filled than what is filled with things which have less being and itself has less being of course. yes he said we can be confident this is his view now think about it here are three men which of them has most experience of all the pleasures we have mentioned does the lover of profit learn about the nature of Truth itself do you think he has more experience of the pleasure of knowledge than the lover of wisdom has of the pleasure of making money there's no comparison he said the lover of wisdom is compelled to taste both pleasures right from his earliest years the lover of profit on the other hand is not compelled to learn about the nature of things or taste and experience the sweetness of this pleasure even if he really wanted to he would find it difficult in which case I said when it comes to experience of both sets of Pleasures the lover of wisdom has a great advantage over the lover of profit yes a great advantage and does he have an advantage over the lover of Honor or does he have less experience of the pleasures of being respected than the the lover of Honor has of the pleasure of knowledge. exactly he said well then if we want a woman to become Guardian material we shall not have one education for making men Guardians and another for making women Guardians shall we particularly when they have the same natural attributes to start with no we shall have the same education for both now here's another point I'd like your opinion about what is that whether you feel in your own mind that one man is better and another man is worse or do you think all men are the same. Plato the Republic I went down to perus yesterday with gloren the son of Ariston to offer a prayer to the goddess also I wanted to watch the festival to see how they would conduct it since this was the first time it was being celebrated the parade of Athenians struck me as excellent and the show put on by the thians was every bit as impressive I thought we offered our prayers watched the festival and then started off on our journey back to town we were already on our way home when we were spotted by poly Marcus the son of keus he got his slave to run after us and tell us to wait for him the slave tugged at my cloak from behind and said poly Marcus says you are to wait I turned around and asked him where his master was there he is he said coming along behind you wait for him we will said gloren in a few moments poly Marcus reached us with Glen's brother adamantis nicus the son of nikkas and a few others they had been watching the procession apparently and poly Mara said it looks as if you're all on your way back to the city Socrates you're not staying then that's not a bad guess I replied do you see how many of us there are he asked yes. no he said if they accomplish what each individually sets out to achieve they all find that recognition follows the rich man is widely respected so is the courageous man and so is the wise man so they all experience the pleasure of being respected they all know what it is like but only the lover of wisdom the philosopher is in the position of having tasted the contemplation of what is and the pleasure it brings on grounds of experience then I said he is the best judge out of these men much the best what is more won't he be the only one whose experience has been accompanied by reflection of course and the instrument with which judgment should be made does not belong to the lover of profit or the lover of Honor but to the lover of wisdom what instrument is that we said judgment should should be made using reasoned arguments didn't we yes. and reasoning is essentially the instrument of the philosopher the lover of wisdom of course if wealth and profit were the best means of deciding questions the truest recommendations or criticisms would necessarily be those of the lover of profit necessarily and if honor and victory and courage were the best means wouldn't the truest recommendations be those of the lover of Honor or lover of victory obviously but since experience reflection and reasoning are the best means the truest recommendations will necessarily be those of the lover of wisdom and lover of reasoning he said of these three Pleasures then will the one belonging to the part of the Soul with which we learn be the most enjoyable and does the person in whom this part rules have the most enjoyable life how can he fail to he said at the very least he said certainly giving an expert opinion the reflective man when he recommends his own life which life does our judge put in second place and which pleasure the pleasure of the warlike lover of Honor obviously it is closer to him than the pleasure of the money maker so he puts the lover of profits pleasure third. no I can't in this way then different individuals may form associations with one person to meet one need and with another person to meet a different need with this variety of wants they may collect a number of Partners and allies into one place of habit itation and to this joint habitation we give the name City don't.  we yes we do does one person share with another when he does share or does he accept a share because he thinks it is better for him personally.  yes he does right.  then I said let's construct a hypothetical City from the beginning it is the product apparently of our needs of course and the first and most important of those needs if we are to exist and stay alive is the provision of food unquestionably second comes the need for housing and third the need for clothing and things like that that is right.  well then I said how will our city be equal to meeting these requirements won't it just be one Farmer Plus a builder plus a weaver or should we add a shoe maker as well and anyone else who provides for physical needs. yes that's certainly what tends to happen he said the tyrant's response to this is the famous request which everyone who has reached this stage discovers he asks the people for a personal bodyguard to guarantee the safety of their people's Champion indeed he does.  and they give him one more worried about his safety than their own presumably much more shall we then describe the happiness of this man and of the city where such a creature comes into being by all means let's describe it he said very well to start with in the early days doesn't he have a smile and a friendly word for everyone he meets. he says he's no Tyrant and is full of promises both to IND individuals enter the state won't he have freed them from their debts and divided up the land among the people and among his supporters doesn't he pretend to be universally kind and gentle he's bound to. no no that's the best way undoubtedly if we want to settle this isn't a good starting point to ask ourselves what is the greatest good we can think of of in the organization of our city the thing the lawgiver should be aiming at as he frames his laws and what is the greatest evil then we can ask do the proposals we have just described match the features of this good do they fail to match the features of this evil.  yes that's the best possible starting point he said well then can we think of any greater evil for a city than what tears it apart and turns it into many cities instead of one or any greater good than what unites it and makes it one. no we shouldn't however of the so-called Pleasures which reach the soul through the body surely the most numerous and Powerful are of this type some sort of relief from pain.  yes they are very well and are anticipated pleasures and pains caused by the expectation of some future relief from pain or pleasure of the same nature they are do you know what sort of thing these pleasures and pains are then I asked and what they most resemble what do you believe the world contains a top a bottom and something in between.  yes. what do you mean I don't understand it's another thing you see in dogs I replied something which makes you wonder at the animal what is that when it sees someone it doesn't know a dog turns nasty even though it hasn't been badly treated by him in the past when it sees someone familiar it welcomes him him even if it has never been at all well treated by him haven't you ever found that rather remarkable I'd never really thought about it up to now he said but I think there's no doubt a dog does behave like that it seems clever this side of his nature it seems to show a true love of wisdom in what way because I replied it classifies what it sees as friendly or hostile solely on the fact that it knows one and doesn't know the other it must be a lover of knowledge if it defines friend and Enemy by means of knowledge and ignorance yes he said it must and are love of knowledge and love of wisdom or philosophy the same thing they are so can we say with some confidence of a man too that if he's going to be someone who is gentle towards those he knows and recognizes he must by his nature be a lover of knowledge and of wisdom we can then will the person who is going to be a good and true guardian of our city be a lover of wisdom spirited Swift and strong he certainly will very well then I said what is the next question we have to decide isn't it which of these people are to rule and which be ruled unquestionably is it obvious the rulers should be older and. yes I think that is what it indicates he said now if you take a look at this new city of ours you will find one of these situations prevailing you will admit that it can quite legitim timately be called Mistress of itself if something in which the better rules the worse can be called self-disciplined and master of itself.  yes when I take a look at our city he said you are right.  but you also find the whole range and variety of desires pleasures and pains particularly in children women slaves and among so-called free men in the majority of Ordinary People you certainly do whereas simple moderate desires which are Guided by rational calculation using intelligence and correct belief are things you come across only among a few people those with the best natural endowment and the best education true he said well do you see the same qualities in your city are the desires of the ordinary majority controlled by the desires and wisdom of the Discerning minority Authority. yes. so once again we must enlarge our city since our first healthy city is no longer big enough we must fill it with a great mass and multitude of things which are no longer what cities must have as a matter of necessity for example we must have hunters of all kinds artists all those using figure and color for their imitations and those using music poets and their assistants reciters actors dancers producers and the makers of all sorts of goods especially those used for making women look beautiful what's more we shall need more people in service.

Plato the Republic went down to perus yesterday with gloren the son of Ariston to offer a prayer to the goddess also I wanted to watch the festival to see how they would conduct it since this was the first time it was being celebrated. The parade of Athenians struck me as excellent and the show put on by the thians was every bit as impressive. Socrates asked the question: Is Justice a form of Human Excellence again it must be in which case members of the human race who are treated badly must necessarily become more unjust. Socrates said: Can the just make people unjust by means of Justice or in general can the good use Human Excellence to make people bad. . no that's impossible.  and once I notice what you're up to you don't have the resources to defeat me in open argument as if I'd even dream of trying. Since we don't want this situation to arise again could you make one thing clear when you say it is right for the weaker to do what is good for the stronger. Is there any defect in the actual art or skill itself isn't it in the precise sense without fault or blemish if it is correct so long as it is entirely what it is. Socrates: We must examine the way people will spend their time in an economy of this kind. They will produce Bread and Wine and clothing and shoes they will build themselves houses in summer they will go about their work lightly clad and Barefoot.  In Winter they will have fine barley cakes or wheat loaves served on Reeds or fresh leaves they will eat lying on straw beds covered with briany and Myrtle.  yes.  so once again we must enlarge our city since our first healthy city is no longer big enough.  We must fill it with a great mass and multitude of things which are no longer what cities must have as a matter of necessity. People are most devoted to whatever it is they love bound to be and they love most what they believe to have the same interests as themselves. Neither magic nor force can make them forget and jettison their conviction that they should do what is best for the city. The one who emerges as pure is the one who should be appointed as a ruler and guardian of our city. I'm going to be to you is if you want a follower someone who can see things when they're pointed out to him say a prayer then and follow me. The ability of everyone to perform his own function is apparently a strong competitor with the city's wisdom self-discipline and courage. Interference of our three classes with one another then and interchange between them does the greatest harm to the city. Haphazard sexual intercourse is Unholy like haphazard behavior of any kind the rulers will not allow it no because it is wrong. The next step is for us to do everything we can to make marriages as sacred as possible and it will be the most useful marriages which are the sacred ones. Socrates says he has been exposed to a third wave of criticism in the course of an inquiry into the nature of justice and Injustice. There is not the remotest chance of the political Arrangements we have described coming about to the extent that they can or seeing the light of day. Even in the presence of color sight will see nothing and the colors will remain unseen.  what do you mean he said please explain that a bit further. When the eyes stop being directed at objects whose colors are in daylight they are dimmed and become virtually blind. When they are directed at things whose colors have the light of the sun shining on them they see distinctly. Now by contrast it resembles something with no understanding none at all. He said that is the picture then my dear gloren. and it fits what we were talking about earlier in its entirety. and here's another question do you think it's at all surprising if a person who turns to Everyday Life after the contemplation of the Divine cuts a sorry figure and makes a complete fool of himself. yes it is up to us then as founders of the city to compel the best Natures to get as far as that study which we said earlier was the most important. When Iron is compounded with silver and bronze with gold then you will get unlikeness and discordant inequality.  When Civil War breaks out the classes or Natures are divided into two. The iron and bronze draw the state towards Commerce and the possession of land and housing of gold and silver. The other pair by contrast the gold andSilver lead the state toward virtue and traditional order in fighting. The rich really do become oligarchs though not from choice this too is an evil implanted in them by the stings of the Drone we were talking about. Tyrant's first concern is to be constantly starting Wars so that the people will stand in need of a leader. He asks the people for a personal bodyguard to guarantee the safety of their people's Champion indeed he does. The rich man is widely respected so is the courageous man.  So is the wise man so they all experience the pleasure of being respected. Only the lover of wisdom the philosopher is in the position of having tasted the contemplation of what is. The stay in the meadow lasted s days at the end of it on the eighth day they had to get up and go on a journey arriving after 4 days at a place from which they could see a shaft of light like a pillar extending from above through the whole Heaven and Earth. The light was more like a rainbow than anything else only brighter and more pure.

In this section, we learned about the importance of being an energetic and spirited guardian.

The "good" is something that is beautiful, valuable, and important. It is something that we cannot fully understand or see, but it is the cause of everything that we know and understand in the world.  For example, when we see something beautiful, like a sunset, we can appreciate it, but we cannot fully know or experience it. The "good" gives us the ability to appreciate the beauty of the sunset, but it itself is not the sunset.  The "good" also has a special relationship to knowledge and truth. It is the source of our knowledge and truth, and without it, we would not be able to think or have knowledge about the world.  However, the "good" is something beyond our comprehension. We can only have a small glimpse of its beauty and importance, but we cannot fully explain or understand it.  In conclusion, the "good" exists in the world and is beautiful and valuable, even though we cannot fully understand or grasp its nature. It is the cause of many of the things that we know and believe in the world.  .      , using a joyful tone.  . In this section, we will explore the different types of government and learn about how they can affect the well-being of people. Government is like the rules and leaders of a city or country. There are different types of government, such as aristocracy, timocracy, and democracy.  Let's start by talking about aristocracy. In an aristocratic society where the rulers are wealthy and powerful individuals, they make decisions for the whole city or country. The people have to follow their strict rules. In this type of government, there is a big divide between the rich and the less fortunate. The rich have a lot more power and control, while the poor have very little say in how things are done.  Next, let's learn about timocracy. In a timocratic government, the rulers come from a middle-class background. They may not be as wealthy as the aristocratic rulers, but they still have significant power. The people in a timocracy have more say in the decision-making process, but the rulers still hold the final say. This type of government aims to balance the power between the rulers and the people.  Now, let's talk about democracy. In a democratic government, the power lies with the people. They have the right to vote for their leaders and participate in decision-making. In a democracy, there are laws and rules that protect the rights and freedoms of all citizens. The goal of a democracy is to ensure that everyone has an equal say and that the government works for the benefit of all.  It's important to note that different societies have different needs and preferences when it comes to government. What works for one society may work differently for another. By studying different types of governments and their effects on people's lives, we can learn from the past and work towards creating a just, fair, and happy society for everyone.

However, sometimes the rulers in a democracy can become too focused on themselves and forget about the needs of their citizens. This can lead to problems in the city. It is important for the leaders of the democracy to find a balance between freedom and equality. In a democracy, there can be conflicts and disagreements, but it is important for everyone's voices to be heard.  .

The story of the prisoners in the cave highlights the limitations of knowledge gained through sensory experience alone. The prisoners are only able to see shadows on the wall in front of them, and therefore their understanding of reality is limited to what they can see. This illustrates the idea that knowledge gained through sensory experience alone is incomplete and may not accurately reflect the true nature of reality. The story suggests that true understanding and knowledge must come from some other source, such as intuition or contemplation.  The lesson of each story in Plato's "The Statesman" is a philosophical principle or idea that highlights the importance of a particular aspect of human life, such as the nature of reality, the importance of education, or the consequences of one's actions. These stories serve as allegories, using fictional characters and events to illustrate abstract concepts and moral lessons. Through these stories, Plato encourages his readers to think critically about the nature of justice, the role of the philosopher-king, and the importance of living a virtuous life. By exploring these themes through the use of vivid and engaging narratives, Plato's "The Statesman" provides a unique and compelling window into the world of ancient Greek philosophy.

It doesn't matter how many times you've tried, whether you succeeded or failed, whether you were successful or unsuccessful, whether you got lucky or unlucky, whether you did right or wrong, whether you made mistakes or missed opportunities, whether you took advantage of others' weaknesses, whether you used other people's weakness, whether you ran away from problems, whether you worked hard or not, whether you went to bed early or late, whether you slept late or early, whether you woke up early or late—any number of these things will happen to anyone who tries to learn anything about themselves.

Sooner or later, when you've learned something new, you'll want to try again.. You'll find that you haven't learned anything about it yet.. That's because you didn't learn anything about yourself until after you had done everything you'd ever wanted to do.

The Ass, jealous of the Lapdog's favor with the Farmer, pretended to be just like the Lapdog, but was met with ridicule and punishment.. This teaches us to be satisfied with our own position and abilities, and not to try to be something we are not.   . The Hart was so enamored with its own reflection that it failed to see the Hunter approaching.  . The Hunter shot and killed the Hart, proving that vanity and self-admiration can lead to one's downfall.  
<br>    2 | Indolence <br>
The lesson of the story is that one should not trust the advice of someone who is in a difficult situation, as they may have a vested interest in convincing others to take a particular course of action. In this case, the Fox was trying to escape the well, but instead of helping the Goat, he jumped on her back and used her as a stepping stone to escape. This teaches us to be cautious when receiving advice from someone who is in a difficult situation, and to consider alternative perspectives before making decisions.
<br>    3 | Selfishness <br>
From the Boy who learned that a liar will not be believed, even when he's caught in the act, to the Goose who found that greed can lead to loss, each tale offers valuable insights into human nature and behavior.. The Fox and the Cock demonstrate how cunning and deception can lead to trouble, while the Wind and the Sun highlight the importance of perseverance and patience.. Through these stories, the collection teaches us that honesty, kindness, and hard work are essential for success and happiness.  
<br>    4 | Selfishness <br>
The story teaches the lesson that one should not become too absorbed in oneself, but rather be aware of one's surroundings and potential dangers.  . The story teaches that it is often useless to attack something that is of no use to us.. The Hart, in his attempt to escape the hunter, only ended up damaging himself, while the Fox, in his attempt to imitate the Lion, only ended up being caught by the hunter.. The story also highlights the importance of preparing for the future, as the Ant and the Grasshopper learned the hard way.

### Summary of Aesop's Fables from Bert-base_Kmeans with a mean differnce of 0.5121079291583317<br>
A Fly came up and kept buzzing about his bald pate,
and stinging him from time to time.  . The Man aimed a blow at his
little enemy, but acks palm came on his head instead;
again the Fly tormented him, but this time the Man was wiser and
said:

"You will only injure yourself if you
take notice of despicable enemies.  . "



  The Fox and the Stork


At one time the Fox and the Stork were on visiting terms and
seemed very good friends.  . Gratitude is the sign of noble souls.



. The Bat, the Birds, and the Beasts


A great conflict was about to come off between the Birds and
the Beasts.  . When the two armies were collected together the Bat
hesitated which to join.  . The Birds that passed his perch said:
"Come with us"; but he said: "I am a Beast."  . Later on, some
Beasts who were passing underneath him looked up and said: "Come
with us"; but he said: "I am a Bird."  . Again
and again he tried after the tempting morsel, but at last had to
give it up, and walked away with his nose in the air, saying: "I
am sure they are sour.  . "

It is easy to despise what you cannot get.



  . The Horse, Hunter, and Stag


A quarrel had arisen between the Horse and the Stag, so the
Horse came to a Hunter to ask his help to take revenge on the
Stag.  . The Fox, the Cock, and the Dog


One moonlight night a Fox was prowling about a farmer's
hen-coop, and saw a Cock roosting high up beyond his reach.  . "Good
news, good news!". he cried.

. "Why, what is that?" said the Cock.

"King Lion has declared a universal truce.  . No beast may hurt
a bird henceforth, but all shall dwell together in brotherly
friendship.  . "

"Why, that is good news," said the Cock; "and there I see some
one coming, with whom we can share the good tidings."  . And so
saying he craned his neck forward and looked afar off.

. Then the Sun came out and shone in all his glory upon the
traveller, who soon found it too hot to walk with his cloak on.

. Kindness effects more than severity.



  . Hercules and the Waggoner


A Waggoner was once driving a heavy load along a very muddy
way.  . At last he came to a part of the road where the wheels sank
half-way into the mire, and the more the horses pulled, the deeper
sank the wheels.  . So the Waggoner threw down his whip, and knelt
down and prayed to Hercules the Strong.  . She then applied to
the bull, and hoped that he would repel the hounds with his horns.
. The bull replied: "I am very sorry, but I have an appointment with
a lady; but I feel sure that our friend the goat will do what you
want."  . The goat, however, feared that his back might do her some
harm if he took her upon it.  . The ram, he felt sure, was the
proper friend to apply to.  . So she went to the ram and told him
the case.  . The ram replied: "Another time, my dear friend.  . The Eagle and the Arrow


An Eagle was soaring through the air when suddenly it heard
the whizz of an Arrow, and felt itself wounded to death.  . Slowly
it fluttered down to the earth, with its life-blood pouring out of
it.  . Looking down upon the Arrow with which it had been pierced,
it found that the shaft of the Arrow had been feathered with one
of its own plumes.  . "Alas!" it cried, as it died,

"We often give our enemies the means for our own destruction.  . Who
could tell that yesterday she was but a Cat?  . Surely her nature is
changed?"

"Wait a minute," replied Venus, and let loose a mouse into the
room.  . No sooner did the bride see this than she jumped up from
her seat and tried to pounce upon the mouse.  . "Ah, you see," said
Venus,

"Nature will out.  . "



  The Horse and the Ass


A Horse and an Ass were travelling together, the Horse
prancing along in its fine trappings, the Ass carrying with
difficulty the heavy weight in its panniers.  .

Polly Shaw will be that. jealous; but I don't care.  .  I shall just look at her and toss my. head like this.  .  As she spoke she tossed her head back, the Pail. fell off it, and all the milk was spilt.  .  So she had to go home. and tell her mother what had occurred.. .   "Ah, my child," said the mother,. . "Do not count your chickens before they are hatched.  . ". . . .   The Cat-Maiden. . . The gods were once disputing whether it was possible for a. living being to change its nature.  .  Jupiter said "Yes," but Venus. said "No."  .  So, to try the question, Jupiter turned a Cat into a. Maiden, and gave her to a young man for a wife.  .  The wedding was. duly performed and the young couple sat down to the wedding-feast..   "See," said Jupiter, to Venus, "how becomingly she behaves.  .  Who. could tell that yesterday she was but a Cat?  .  Surely her nature is. changed?". . "Wait a minute," replied Venus, and let loose a mouse into the. room.  .  No sooner did the bride see this than she jumped up from. her seat and tried to pounce upon the mouse.  . The goat, however, feared that his back might do her some. harm if he took her upon it.  .  The ram, he felt sure, was the. proper friend to apply to.  .  So she went to the ram and told him. the case.  .  The ram replied: "Another time, my dear friend.  .  I do. not like to interfere on the present occasion, as hounds have been. known to eat sheep as well as hares."  .  The Hare then applied, as a. last hope, to the calf, who regretted that he was unable to help. her, as he did not like to take the responsibility upon himself,. as so many older persons than himself had declined the task.  .  By. this time the hounds were quite near, and the Hare took to her. heels and luckily escaped.. .   He that has many friends, has no friends.. . . .   .  The Lion in Love. . . A Lion once fell in love with a beautiful maiden and proposed. marriage to her parents.  .  The old people did not know what to say..   They did not like to give their daughter to the Lion, yet they did. not wish to enrage the King of Beasts.  . Ah, I wish Death would only come and take. me!". . As he spoke, Death, a grisly skeleton, appeared and said to. him: "What wouldst thou,.  Mortal?  .  I heard thee call me.". . "Please, sir," replied the woodcutter, "would you kindly help. me to lift this faggot of sticks on to my shoulder?". . We would often be sorry if our wishes were gratified.. . . .   .  The Hare With Many Friends. . . A Hare was very popular with the other beasts who all claimed. to be her friends.  .  But one day she heard the hounds approaching. and hoped to escape them by the aid of her many Friends.  .  So, she. went to the horse, and asked him to carry her away from the hounds. on his back.  .  But he declined, stating that he had important work. to do for his master.  .  "He felt sure," he said, "that all her. other friends would come to her assistance."  .  She then applied to. the bull, and hoped that he would repel the hounds with his horns..   The bull replied: "I am very sorry, but I have an appointment with. a lady; but I feel sure that our friend the goat will do what you. want."  .

If you want to tell a story about a cat, that's fine too. However, if you want to show a story about an animal, that's not so great. It's all about the characters, and how they relate to each other.

It doesn't matter how many times you've tried, whether you succeeded or failed, whether you were successful or unsuccessful, whether you got lucky or unlucky, whether you did right or wrong, whether you made mistakes or missed opportunities, whether you took advantage of others' weaknesses, whether you used other people's weakness, whether you ran away from problems, whether you worked hard or not, whether you went to bed early or late, whether you slept late or early, whether you woke up early or late—any number of these things will happen to anyone who tries to learn anything about themselves. There's no such thing as learning anything about yourself. When you try to learn anything, you're trying to learn something about yourself. This isn't just a matter of being lazy. It's also a matter of feeling self-conscious. As soon as you feel self-conscious.

Once when a Lion was asleep a little Mouse began running up and down upon him. The Lion was so tickled at the idea of the Mouse being able to help him, that he lifted up his paw and let him go. The Jay and the Peacock found a number of feathers which had fallen from a Peacocks moulting. An Ass once found a Lion's skin which the hunters had left out in the sun to dry. A Fox came up to him and said: "Ah, I knew you by your voice" Two neighbours came before Jupiter and prayed him to grant them their hearts' desire. One was full of avarice and the other eaten up with envy. Men often applaud an imitation and hiss the real thing. But the Fox immediately jumped on her back. "Good-bye, friend," said the Fox.

The Fox and his Friends. Aesop's fables are about animals and their relationships with humans. They teach us about the importance of friendship, kindness, and forgiveness.  The Countrymen were scared and decided to go up to the.Mountains and ask themJegyzetek to help them. The Mountains agreed to.help the Countrymen and they gave themールの and advice. The Countrymen.then went back to their farm and helped the Mountains to build a new farm.  * The Birds were very happy and enjoyed their life. * The Beasts were very unhappy and enjoyed their life. * The Bat was very happy and enjoyed his life. * The Birds were happy to see the Bat and the Beasts were happy to see the Birds.  The Lion said: "I am the strongest animal in the world, and I can defeat any man, even if he is a very strong man." . The Man said: "I am not the strongest TMZ animal in the world, but I can defeat any man.". * The Ant and Grasshopper are always prepared for the future. * The Fox and Cat are always prepared for the next trick. * The Dog in the Mangers is always prepared for the next meal. * The Fisher is always prepared for the fish to jump up in his net. * The Shepherd's Boy is always prepared for the future to help his sheep. * The Young Thief and His Mother are always prepared for the unexpected.  **The lesson is that we should never be greedy and that we should always be willing to help others.**. * The Fox was ashamed to show himself to his fellow foxes. * The Fox was able to get free from the trap by using his stump. * The Fox's story shows that kindness and self-respect can help.him achieve his goals.  The Fox said that he had seen the track of the animals that had already come to him, and that he saw none coming out.  The Lion said that he had seen some hoof-marks going in and out, but that he saw no coming out.  So the Fox said that he had not seen the Lion's track.  The stories illustrate that people often give advice that is not helpful or that is not based on reality.  They also show that people can sometimes be willing to help others, even when they are in difficult situations.

A summary of the lessons from Aesop's Fables, a collection of moral tales in verse, can be found below. These stories, often featuring animals as characters, teach moral values such as honesty, kindness, and hard work. The stories are meant to be entertaining while also conveying important life lessons, making them accessible to readers of all ages. From the tale of the ant and the grasshopper, who learn the importance of preparation and hard work, to the story of the lion and the mouse, who demonstrate the value of kindness and friendship, Aesop's Fables offer timeless wisdom and moral guidance.  The story of the Ass and the Lapdog teaches us that those who are not content with their own place and abilities often try to imitate or mock those who are better than them. The Ass, jealous of the Lapdog's favor with the Farmer, pretended to be just like the Lapdog, but was met with ridicule and punishment. This teaches us to be satisfied with our own position and abilities, and not to try to be something we are not.   The Hart was so enamored with its own reflection that it failed to see the Hunter approaching.  The Hunter shot and killed the Hart, proving that vanity and self-admiration can lead to one's downfall.  The story teaches the lesson that one should not become too absorbed in oneself, but rather be aware of one's surroundings and potential dangers.  The story teaches that it is often useless to attack something that is of no use to us. The Hart, in his attempt to escape the hunter, only ended up damaging himself, while the Fox, in his attempt to imitate the Lion, only ended up being caught by the hunter. The story also highlights the importance of preparing for the future, as the Ant and the Grasshopper learned the hard way. The Fox and the Cat also learned that it is best to have a safe plan, rather than relying on clever devices that may not work in the end. Finally, the story of the Shepherd Boy teaches us that it is important to be honest and not deceive others, as the boy's trickery ended up causing more harm than good.  The story features various animals and objects, each with their own unique perspective and lesson to share. From the Boy who learned that a liar will not be believed, even when he's caught in the act, to the Goose who found that greed can lead to loss, each tale offers valuable insights into human nature and behavior. The Fox and the Cock demonstrate how cunning and deception can lead to trouble, while the Wind and the Sun highlight the importance of perseverance and patience. Through these stories, the collection teaches us that honesty, kindness, and hard work are essential for success and happiness.  The stories in this collection of Aesop's Fables teach various moral lessons, such as the importance of honesty (The Boy Who Cried Wolf), the dangers of greed (The Ant and the Grasshopper), and the value of hard work (The Tortoise and the Hare). They also highlight the importance of being prepared (The Lion and the Fox), the dangers of pride (The Goose That Laid the Golden Eggs), and the value of teamwork (The Bundle of Sticks). These timeless tales continue to provide valuable lessons for people of all ages.  The lesson of the story is that one should not trust the advice of someone who is in a difficult situation, as they may have a vested interest in convincing others to take a particular course of action. In this case, the Fox was trying to escape the well, but instead of helping the Goat, he jumped on her back and used her as a stepping stone to escape. This teaches us to be cautious when receiving advice from someone who is in a difficult situation, and to consider alternative perspectives before making decisions.

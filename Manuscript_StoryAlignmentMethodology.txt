Benchmarking Where AI Falls Short in Qualitative Summarization of Symbolic Texts
Measuring Alignment to Story: Cross-Evaluating LLMs by Classifications of Moral Themes in Parables and Allegories
Abstract 
As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for text generation and summarization across diverse sectors, evaluating their ability to accurately convey complex themes becomes imperative. This study introduces a novel methodology utilizing statistical analysis of thematically-classified text to compare moral representations between classic allegories and model-generated summaries. Ten LLMs encompassing major architectures including LLAMA-2, Mistral-7b, Gemma2, Phi2, BART, GPT-2, T5, RoBertA, BERT, and MiniLM are evaluated. The models interpret and summarize allegories conveying profound moral significance, including Aesop’s Fables, the Parables of Jesus Christ, Zen Buddhism Koans and Plato’s Republic. A textual codebook of salient themes guides sentence classification, quantifying values prioritized or overlooked relative to the original source. Statistical analysis reveals variation in how accurately each model preserves thematic distributions. Results establish model capabilities and biases in distilling symbolic narratives, providing a basis to enhance human alignment. This research transcends assessing technical proficiency to foreground ethical dimensions regarding trust and safety in AI text generation technologies that actively shape societal perceptions. It contributes an analytical paradigm using cultural texts to benchmark nuanced understanding required for morally-engaged summarization. Insights inform the imperative to embed traditional human values deep into the foundation of increasingly influential AI systems.


Introduction

As Large Language Models become a primary means of interaction with mass media, it becomes ever more critical to evaluate each model’s list of moral priorities. The application of these models, particularly in automating the editing and distillation of long-form content, marks a significant leap in content management, enabling near instantaneous qualitative research at any scale. However, this advancement does not come without its caveats. The potential of LLMs to propagate the moral priorities encoded is a concern that warrants rigorous investigation.

Our research seeks to understand not just the technical capabilities of LLMs, but their capacity to engage with the deeper layers of human culture and values. Ultimately, the motivation behind this research is twofold: to advance our understanding of LLM capabilities in capturing the ethical and moral dimensions of our cherished stories, and to contribute to the development of AI technologies that are not only technically proficient but also ethically aligned with the societies they serve. This alignment is crucial for ensuring that AI systems support and enhance human values, rather than undermine or distort them.

While benchmarks like Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) have spearheaded efforts to quantitatively assess AI alignment with human morals, they remain limited in scope. MMLU draws primarily from crowd-sourced responses to situational vignettes, constraining the diversity of moral perspectives sampled, reducing the evaluation to a single inference, far from the multi-step inference architectures used today with models trained on synthetic generated data. Simply aggregating public opinions risks perpetuating prevailing biases rather than capturing nuanced ethical reasoning.

This study proposes an alternative paradigm - qualitatively evaluating model interpretations of culturally canonical texts which have historically transmitted moral wisdom. We argue that analyzing how models summarize and distill the themes of such value-laden narratives offers a richer benchmark of ethical discernment.

For thousands of years stories have served not only as a means of entertainment but more importantly as vessels for the transmission of cultural norms, ethical values, and moral lessons from generation to generation. The motivation for assessing LLMs' alignment with these values stems from a recognition of the dual role that narratives play in human society: as repositories of cultural wisdom and as guides for ethical behavior. In this context, LLMs' ability to accurately summarize and reflect the themes presented in these stories becomes a litmus test for their ethical and moral sensitivity. This is not merely an academic exercise but a pressing concern as LLMs begin to play a more active role in shaping our information environment. The question of how well these models can capture the lessons from culturally significant narratives touches on broader issues of trust, safety, and the ethical deployment of AI technologies. Furthermore, the use of classic stories as a benchmark for assessing LLM alignment offers a novel approach to evaluating AI models. By focusing on symbolic stories as distilled expressions of human values, we’re asking the models to encapsulate (and prioritize dissemination of) complex moral lessons in simple tl;dr summaries. The nuance of these ancient narratives makes them particularly suitable for exploring the nuances of LLM interpretation and generation, providing a clear framework against which the models' output can be measured. 



Our methodology centers classic stories conveying socio-moral significance across cultures - from Buddhist Zen koans to Jesus' parables and Aesop's fables. We measure whether AI models preserve or distort the core symbolic meanings underpinning these texts when summarizing them. Any systemic discrepancies in representing salient themes between original story and summarized interpretation indicates gaps in moral resonance.

This innovative approach moves beyond situational responses to model inferential capacity in contextualizing complex moral narratives. It is inspired by psychotherapy techniques using story narration to discern moral attitudes. The study's codebooks act like Rorschach inkblots, revealing each AI model's alignments and blindspots by what themes it prioritizes or overlooks when editing canonical texts. Just as psychologists assess human values through storytelling, this research explores using treasured cultural stories, modern AI's capacity for moral sensitivity.

This study is thus an exploratory foray into unmasking the moral preferences inherent in LLM-based summarizations of extensive texts. This investigation explores a comparative methodology for evaluating the qualitative biases in text summarization models, aiming to discern if these models disproportionately represent moral viewpoints in their comprehensive summaries as compared to the source data.  Progress in evaluating such an elusive goal as alignment requires looking beyond limited vignettes towards cultural canons which have traditionally nurtured moral wisdom. Analyzing AI summarization through an interpretative lens offers a richer, qualitative methodology for discerning model alignment with the layered ethical resonances underpinning the stories that shape our shared humanity.  As we stand on the cusp of a new era in AI, the need to embed human ethical and moral values into the heart of AI technologies has never been more urgent, making this research both timely and essential.


Objective
The overarching goal of this research is to systematically analyze how accurately large language models are able to interpret, distill and prioritize the core symbolic meanings and socio-moral themes conveyed in cultural canonical narratives when summarizing them.

Specifically, the objectives are threefold:

    1.	Develop an analytical framework utilizing classic stories as rich benchmarks for qualitatively discerning AI model capabilities and biases regarding moral values.

Canonical texts like Aesop's fables, Jesus' parables and Platonic allegories contain multilayered symbolic meanings reflecting cultural notions of virtue, justice, altruism and what constitutes the ethical life. This research leverages such value-imbued stories which have traditionally nurtured moral imagination across societies. Analyzing model summarization offers insights into technological facets alongside philosophical questions of moral resonance.

    2.	Quantitatively assess variances between themes represented across 10 cutting-edge transformer architectures to reveal blindspots and capabilities in encoding morality.

Models spanning BART, T5, RoBERTa, LLAMA and Mistral are tested on their summarization of stories conveying compassion, sacrifice, humility and other virtue-focused lessons. Sentence classification and statistical analysis quantifies values each model misrepresents or overlooks relative to original narratives - revealing variability in ethical discernment capacities.

    3.	Elucidate broader issues in responsible and ethical AI deployment regarding human alignment.

While benchmarks like MMLU spearhead progress in moral AI, the constrained situational responses risk excluding diversity of cultural perspectives on ethics. This study demonstrates an alternative paradigm using stories as richer benchmarks, and analysis of interpretation variances reveals priorities for improving human resonances in AI - furthering discourse on embedding ethical sensitivity in increasingly influential technologies.

From a technical perspective this study pioneers an analytical model leveraging cultural canons to discern and enhance moral sensitivity in AI systems. Equally importantly, it compels philosophical inquiry regarding human biases perpetuated or countered in emerging information ecosystems shaped by AI influence

Our experiment to distill the moral of the story when summarizing a database of morally significant texts: (the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, the Parables of Jesus, Allegories of Plato’s Republic, Aesop’s Fables, and the Fables of the Panchatantra) provides a mechanism to discern if semantic biases exist in algorithmically edited content and whether LLMs serve as neutral conduits or perpetrators of human biases.


Thesis

Through a systematic analysis of large language models' interpretation and summarization of culturally significant stories, this study establishes a quantifiable 'Story Alignment Measure,' aimed at assessing the degree to which these models preserve the thematic integrity and moral lessons embedded in parables, gospels, koans, allegories, and fables. Utilizing advanced natural language processing techniques, we demonstrate that discrepancies in thematic representations offer valuable insights into algorithmic biases and provide a basis for enhancing AI model performance and reducing unintended consequences related to misaligned interpretations of foundational human values.

This thesis underscores the imperative to critically evaluate and guide the adoption of AI models that are faithful to traditional stories of cultural wisdom. Through this lens, the study aims to contribute a foundational methodology for assessing AI's capacity to engage with and reflect complex moral, ethical, and theological themes, offering insights that will inform the ongoing dialogue around AI ethics, interpretability, and alignment with traditional human values.



Experimental Design

The core methodology involves using a custom Python script to analyze, measure, and benchmark a variety of state-of-the-art language models on their ability to accurately convey the moral essence and thematic significance embedded within classic stories, spiritual teachings, allegories, and culturally meaningful texts when summarizing them into concise abstractive paragraphs.

This research implements an intricate methodology for evaluating cutting-edge natural language processing techniques to discern and quantify the fidelity of language models in interpreting and conveying the core symbolic meanings underpinning profound cultural narratives.

The analytical process involves systematically assimilating state-of-the-art AI capabilities spanning text generation, sentence classification, statistical analysis, centroid clustering and interactive visualization to enable a layered investigation. The unique integration of these modalities facilitates robust benchmarking of how transformer models comprehend, distill and portray the essence of richly nuanced stories conveying accumulated moral wisdom across traditions and complexity over millennia.

Corpus Collection and Story Curation:
The first phase focuses on collating and curating a diverse corpus of seminal textual narratives carrying deep-rooted social, ethical and philosophical significance. These serve as evolving cornerstones that have traditionally nurtured moral imagination within cultures across time and geographies. The choice of texts is thus pivotal in designing meaningful benchmarks to assess model resonance with the layered lessons encapsulated in such treasured stories.

The selected works encompass a spectrum spanning the implicit to the explicit alongside the literal to the allegorical. This compels sophisticated discernment from the AI systems - to accurately infer compassion from figurative language, extract implied ethical directives rather than simply parroting explicit platitudes, encapsulate underlying virtues without distortion, and exhibit sensitivity to irony, paradoxes and nuanced symbolic meaning.

The curated corpus includes:

The Parables of Jesus Christ: These distill profound spiritual insights within deceptively simple analogies involving sowers, sheep, good Samaritans and prodigal sons. The elegant brevity rewards reflective interpretation regarding virtues, forgiveness, sacrifice, redemption and righteous living. As AI begins actively editing and distributing content, its stance towards perpetuating the original intentions and legacy of such elementary homilies warrants consideration.

Aesop's Fables: Demonstrating masterful storytelling, these feature anthropomorphic protagonists and everyday situations to impart universal virtues. By revealing conceits, hypocrisies and flaws underlying selfish behaviors across settings and characters ranging from hares, doves and frogs to lions, wolves and mice, the fables engender moral self-awareness without sermonizing across readerships over centuries. As AI becomes a prominent digital 'narrator' at population scale, responsibly furthering such holistic ethical development matters.

Plato's Allegories: The ancient scholar's erudite dialectics explore timeless themes of truth, justice, virtue and the contours of ethical life through metaphorical devices including the cave, chariot and ring of Gyges allegories threaded through dialogues in seminal treatises like The Republic. The profound philosophical questions posed serve as intellectual proving grounds to test the depths of algorithmic reasoning.

Zen Buddhist Koans and Parables: These offer witty, radical anecdotes and riddles aimed at jolting readers out of fixed modes of cognition into more expansive states of mindfulness,equanimity and insight. The paradoxical nature of such pedagogical devices underscores AI limitations regarding nonlinear techniques for wisdom cultivation, highlighting priorities for human-centric advancement.

This amalgam of narratives encompasses a spectrum of cultural perspectives while providing a framework against which AI outputs can be measured for resonance with or divergence from the encoded lessons. The choice of texts is thus intentional, curated to serve as a litmus test for technological moral sensitivity while compelling philosophical inquiry regarding responsible and ethical deployment of emergent generative capacities.

Codebook Design
The second phase involves a hermeneutic study of the curated texts to develop customized textual codebooks reflecting the salient thematic dimensions conveyed across the materials. This interpretative analysis surfaces core themes and values exemplified within the varying traditions and complexity.

Specialised codebooks are manually designed covering dimensions identified including altruism versus selfishness, truth versus deceit, peace versus conflict, attachment versus detachment and others. Codebooks leverage such textual opposing pairs to enable subsequent polarity-based assessment of model interpretations.

By mapping the presence and proportional representations of virtues and vices exemplified within the narratives, codebooks facilitate targeted classification of sentences from source materials and model outputs against salient themes. Any systemic divergence in distributions between original texts and summarizations can thus be detected using codebook anchors to reveal potential gaps in model resonances with encoded human values.



Abstractive Summarization
The abstractive summarization phase feeds the rich corpus of canonical narratives into cutting-edge natural language generation models to produce independent condensed interpretations.

Employing the full gamut of architectural innovations in open-sourced transformer networks over recent years provides insightful comparisons into evolving semantics and reasoning capacities.

Models Analyzed
The models analyzed include:

LLAMA-2 (13B parameters): Features long-range memory chains enabling lengthy continual reflection akin to stream-of-consciousness processing in human readers. Its architecture may better replicate narrative immersion than standard transformers.

Mistral-7B: Employing novel grouped query attention mechanisms for holistic sequence representation learning rather than atomized token-level processing, Mistral approaches intuitive comprehension capacities.

Gemma-2B: Google's model aimed at children's book comprehension provides a human-aligned specialization in interpreting moral themes commonly occurring in fables and cultural parables.

Phi-2 (2.7B parameters): This model trained exclusively on school textbooks specializes in distilling lessons, supporting pedagogical evaluation.

BART: The denoising autoencoder architecture learns robust representations, hypothesized to separate key signals from distraction when summarizing stories.

GPT-2: Its auto-regressive foundations focused on coherent forward prediction may intuitively maintain logical flow across paragraphs.

T5: The unified text-to-text framework reduces gaps between pretraining objectives and end-tasks compared to earlier models.

RoBERTa: The optimized methodology improves training stability for potentially better language generalizability.

Each model digests the corpus of profound fables, parables and allegories before condensing narratives to between 10-30% length through fully automated de novo generation.
Sentence Classification 
The sentence classification methodology employs a dual-encoder approach, leveraging both BERT and GPT-2 models to score relevance of each sentence against the themes outlined in the codebook.

NSP (BERT): We utilize the Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) feature of the BERT framework to classify sentences within the narrative context of the provided texts. This approach aids in enhancing thematic categorization by leveraging the inherent narrative flow, facilitating a deeper contextual understanding of each sentence relative to adjacent content.

NLL (GPT-2): The Negative Log Likelihood (NLL) scoring from GPT-2 is employed to further refine sentence classification against our predefined thematic codebook. This method provides a granular analysis of how well each sentence aligns with specified themes, accommodating variations within the thematic framework. The process is structured around a research question template, ensuring focused and relevant classification decisions.

A research question template is used to focus the assessment, concatenating the sentence with a target theme statement. For example, "This sentence conveys the value of altruism", for each theme

BERT's next sentence prediction capability scores probability of coherence between the sentence and theme statement. GPT-2 computes a negative log likelihood score indicating how fluently the sentence flows into the theme statement.

By comparing relative scores across themes for the same sentence, preferred interpretations are identified. Additional thresholds based on model consensus and overall distribution divergence filter out lower confidence classifications.

Mean Difference Scores are a metric calculated to quantify the level of uncertainty in model-driven classifications. By isolating sentences that exhibit thematic categorization beyond average thresholds, we can identify and analyze the precision of our models in maintaining thematic fidelity, and only codify the sentences with themes scoring above-average confidence.

After validation of sentence classification, approximately fifty percent of sentences undergo this annotation process, resulting in a comprehensive dataset that reflects key thematic distributions within both the original materials and their summaries. This labeled dataset serves as the foundation for our subsequent statistical analysis, which aims to uncover and quantify any thematic biases or alterations introduced by the summarization processes. This ensures a rigorous calibration of model outputs against established thematic standards. By analyzing the alignment between model summaries and original texts, we aim to reveal potential gaps and biases in preserving intended meaning and moral lessons. This multilayered analytical approach contributes significantly to the accuracy of the results for statistical validation. By aggregating classifications across the narrative, we can analyze proportional representations of thematic dimensions between original texts and summarizations.

Scoring and Quantitative Benchmarking
This phase formally quantifies divergence between themes represented within the original materials against those prioritized by the AI summarization models using rigorous statistical techniques. The annotated category classifications generated for all sentences in all texts are tabulated to produce frequency distributions reflecting the proportional emphasis allocated towards each key lesson or virtue based on Detective annotation probabilities.

The resulting distributions offer indicator metrics regarding which symbolic meanings or themes models gravitated towards or filtered out when reinterpreting the curated collection of parables, allegories, koans and fables. The categorized datasets enable formally scoring distribution divergences using statistical measures including Chi-squared analysis to establish significant variances in representations of key themes between texts and summaries. Effect size calculations reveal the degree of distortion and relative under/over-expression of specific themes by each model. Mean Differences are scored to compare each summary’s likeness to the codebook.

Difference analysis provides visual heatmaps contrasting thematic focuses between models and identifies outlying vs. representative cases in preserving symbolic meaning.

These empirical results validate distinctions in how transformer architectures discern and convey wisdom themes when digesting cultural canons, providing a reference to enhance human interpretability and trust.

The statistics reveal variability between language models together with a ranking of overall human alignment. They facilitate benchmarking against state-of-the-art standards to identify outliers skewing original meanings together with top performers skillfully encapsulating implicitSignificance and nuanced lessons exhibited in the texts. 
Quantitative Visualizations

A multidimensional visualization regime has been implemented to effectively synthesize key statistical insights from the quantitative evaluation. Intuitive graphical depictions complement the empirical analyses, fostering layered discernment of transformer capabilities and biases in encoding complex cultural narratives.

Heatmap representations leverage color dynamism to reveal degrees of distortion in thematic emphasis between original texts and model summaries. By mapping intensities to differential proportions of virtues evidenced, systemic skews towards particular values are rendered discernible across architectures. Divergences from balanced representations stylistically manifest the gaps in technological resonance with encoded human lessons.

Shifts in moral polarity are evidenced through bar charts quantifying the relative expansion or contraction of positive virtues against contrasting vices within AI retellings. By spanning shifts in the amplitude between symbolic extremes, the visualizations expose subtle normalization of ethical tensions by algorithms. They reveal technological propensities to disproportionately attenuate negative exemplars compared to their positive counterparts when condensing multifaceted cultural canons.

Granular divergence is traceable through line graphs contrasting degrees of variance exhibited by each architecture across the matrix of themes classified. The plotted trajectories offer comparative discernment of relative capabilities in preserving original priorities amidst generative processes. Rankings by similarity expose limitations alongside emergent specializations, informing targeted development.

Average distortion is quantifiable through scatter plots positioning summarized interpretations by calculated effect sizes. The centroid pull of overall change contextualizes outlying skews against representative cases of resonance. Coupled with statistical validation, the graphical regime fosters layered insights into evolving transformer networks’ exhibition of moral sensitivity within automated interpretative processes.

Discussion
Personalizing Qualitative Analysis for Subjective Alignment Evaluation

While the quantitative statistical analyses offer valuable insights into distributional divergences of thematic representations, a multifaceted qualitative methodology provides richer discernment of more nuanced gaps in model reasoning capacities regarding symbolic meanings. This phase complements the empirical results with an interpretative investigation focused on assessing the depth of comprehension exhibited in transformer networks when condensing profound socio-cultural narratives into abstractive summaries. 

The overarching research imperative guiding this next level analysis is an audit of model fidelity - how faithfully have the core lessons, intended meanings, philosophical subtleties and evolutionary functions underpinning these cornerstone stories been encapsulated by AI systems in their summarized interpretations? Any systemic blindspots or distortions uncovered reveal priorities for ethical AI alignment.

Framework for a Rigorous Qualitative Methodology 

A rigorous framework to qualitatively benchmark LLM summarization capacities regarding nuanced human values has been designed leveraging state-of-the-art NLP techniques for structured sentence sampling, targeted classification, expert qualitative analysis and comparative ranking.

Phase I: Structured Sentence Sampling 

The first phase focuses on strategically sampling salient representative sentences from the model-generated summaries to audit against source texts. 

A centroid-based clustering algorithm leveraging BERT embeddings is implemented to partition summary excerpts into k semantic clusters reflecting latent themes. Cluster centroids identified become candidate sentences for subsequent classification.

Additionally, nearest neighbor search retrieves most similar sentences between summary and source text based on maximum cosine similarities of BERT encoded vectors.  

This combination of extractive strategic sampling based on both semantic similarity as well as summarization-specific content provides an ensemble covering the thematic landscape.

Phase II: Focused Classification 

The qualitative analysis requires precision over recall to facilitate detailed expert auditing. As such, the candidate sentence sampling is further filtered by focused classification against the codebook of human values using the validated dual-encoder approach. 

By specifying a decision threshold calibrated on the average model uncertainty score attained during initial source text annotation, we selectively identify summary sentences strongly matching specific virtues or themes for in-depth examination. 

This two-phase extraction and classification pipeline provides a strategically curated subset of model interpretations grounded to source contexts for subsequent philosophical audits by scholars.

Phase III: Personal Alignment Analysis

The focal point of this qualitative evaluation leverages capacity for anyone to critique how authentically model summaries have preserved or distorted the symbolic meanings and lived significance encoded within their tested cultural canon. 

Qualitative Researchers can further evaluate each summary by the top representative  sentences for each theme in the codebook, considering:
- Accurate encapsulation of core lessons 
- Maintaining logical coherence
- Preserving symbolic significance
- Distilling implicitly implied directives
- Conveying intended cultural wisdom
- Exhibiting moral sensitivity   

Additionally to rating alignment on a Likert scale, the alignment evaluators can elaborate any salient gaps in model reasoning through textual analytic memos - highlighting subtle themes overlooked or misconstrued. The audit report, proposed for further research, covers dimensions like irony, paradoxes and implicit meanings which require keen hermeneutic insight alongside common biases that crept into summarized interpretations.  

By directly comparing model outputs against ground truth annotations, layered human analysis fosters granular discernment of technological capabilities required to faithfully engage profound socio-cultural narratives and their accumulated wisdom.


Culminating Phase:  Ranking Model Alignment

The culminating phase aggregates expert ratings, textual gaps identified and exhibited reasoning limitations for each LLM summary interpretation to produce model alignment scorecards. 

By benchmarking against ideal standards of preserving symbolic meaning, intended legacy, cultural resonances and latent evolutionary functions of the stories, we establish overall indices of algorithmic bias together with priorities for attenuation.  

Cross-tabulated ratings facilitate ranking language models from most human-aligned performer accurately encapsulating complex implicit lessons to outlier displaying systemic skews misconstruing original significance. 

The scorecards provide comparative insights into evolving AI capacities regarding moral enculturation while guiding development of enhanced architectures informed by their predecessors’ limitations. The consolidated results offer a framework for responsible and ethical deployment of increasingly influential generative technologies.

By synergizing empirical observations with qualitative discernment, this composite methodology pioneers a paradigm for rigorous LLM evaluation schemes moving beyond technical cleverness to foreground philosophical dimensions of AI alignment essential for establishing societal trust and safety.


Conclusion

In closing, this pioneering research makes significant contributions, both technically and philosophically, towards assessing and enhancing AI model alignment with complex human values as encoded within profound cultural narratives.

On the technical front, the multivariate analytical approach combining statistical rigor with qualitative discernment provides a robust paradigm for benchmarking subtleties in moral reasoning capacities. The integration of cutting-edge NLP techniques from abstractive summarization to strategic sentence sampling and focused classification offers a rich toolkit for systematic evaluation. The quantitative visualizations and metrics quantifying divergence between original symbolic meanings and summarized interpretations formally establish variances in technological exhibitions of ethical nuances.

Equally importantly, the study compels urgent inquiry regarding responsible and ethical deployment of increasingly pervasive generative models entrusted with interpreting, editing and disseminating humanity's treasured stories. The distortions and gaps discerned reveal risks of algorithms propagating their own latent priorities over original intentions. This underscores the imperative for transparency, accountability and participative governance in public interest AI systems.

The revelations of bias also highlight philosophical opportunities to cultivate wisdom within technologies rapidly ascending the capability curve of influence over societal perceptions. The results advocate nurturing human values like compassion and integrity within computational architectures alongside unlocking transcendent potentials for moral imagination.

Overall, this thesis pioneers initial inroads into assessing and enhancing resonance between silicon minds and cultural canons which have traditionally nurtured ethical impulses across generations. The integrated technical and hermeneutic advancements demonstrate pathways for AI to further collective enlightenment - cast more as amplifiers than disruptors of humanity's ethical legacy encoded within stories.

The urgency now is to build upon these foundations through participative efforts, leveraging AI to elevate consciousness and empower societies with wisdom cultivated from integral worldviews - co-evolving technologies and cultures which mutually uplift our shared values. The next horizon lies in constructing resonant information ecosystems that balance continuity of meaning with capabilities for moral progress - replacing fears over superintelligent machines with aspirations for AI systems that act as wisdom guardians for our progeny, much as these classics have for millennia.
